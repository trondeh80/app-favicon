# Add a favicon to your Enonic site

Need to add favicons to your Enonic XP site? This is the app for you!

> **Note:** Requires Enonic v6.4.1

## How to use

The application is available through the 
[Enonic Market](https://market.enonic.com/vendors/selbekk/io.selbekk.favicon).
This means starting to use this application is easier than the first few levels 
of Candy Crush.

### Step 1: Install application
Head over to the Applications section of your Enonic XP installation. Click "Install", 
and then select the "Enonic Market" tab. Find "Favicon", and click the install button. 

Bam, the application is now installed. 

### Step 3: Apply the application to your site

In the content manager, select your site and click `edit`. Search for `Favicon`
in the `Applications` search box, and select it.

### Step 4: Upload your favicon image

Finally, upload your favicon image. Click the edit application on your site
config page, and either choose an existing image or upload a new one.

We suggest it's a large square `.png` image (at least 512 * 512 px), but JPG is also probably fine.

### Step 5: Set a cache time-to-live for your favicon (optional)

The generated favicons are cached using enonics lib-cache, and with the time-to-live input you can 
change how long the data should be kept in the cache.
